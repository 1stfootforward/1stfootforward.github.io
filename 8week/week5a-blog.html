	                    <p>Being active may be different for different people, however, it's important to be active in some way or another every day. Whether it’s getting out for a walk around the block or playing a team sport, joining a gym or small group classes, there are a variety of ways to fill up your exercise plan with different activities for the week. </p>

				                		<h5><b>Get a pedometer</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>One of the best ways I've found that helps my clients start to get active is by giving them a pedometer. Set your goal low to start with 2000 steps, then keep adding to your goal like another 100 steps a day. Before long with a little effort, you will find yourself doing upwards of 8000 a day. </p>

										<h5><b>Start working out at home</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>Working out at home is very convenient, and takes a lot of the stress and time limits getting to and from your workouts. You can workout using your body weight or by incorporating household goods for weights, (a few cans of spaghetti is a good place to start). </p>

										
											

										<h5><b>Get a skipping Rope</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>If you have small children at home and can't get out for a jog or run like you used to be able to do, get a skipping rope. Skipping for 3 minutes is equivalent to jogging for 30 minutes. </p>

										<h5><b>Stretching</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>Stretching is important with any fitness goal, if you include it, in your daily routine it will help you recover faster, which means less sore muscles, flexibility, and relaxing as mentioned before. As stretching is an excellent way to help your muscles heal faster and relieve you of any aches and pains old or new. </p>
										<p>Have you checked out the Yoga from week 1 yet? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ6NfFIr2jw?list=PLui6Eyny-UzzWwB4h9y7jAzLbeuCUczAl">If not here’s the link</a></p>

										<h5><b>Bike or walk to work</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>If you can this is a great way to include fitness into your day. You could start out biking or walk once a week then slowly add to it. </p>

										<p> <a href="http://www.mapmywalk.com/nz/">Map my walk</a></p>

										<h5><b>HIIT</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>Do short bursts of activity like HIIT – High-intensity interval training. This helps you to burn ample calories in a short amount of time.</p>

										<h5><b>Clean the house </b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>Cleaning the house and other household chores can actually be made into and an awesome workout. I treat mowing the lawns as a cardio workout, each time trying to beat my time.</p>

										<h5><b>Take the stairs</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>Take the stairs, this is an awesome way to burn extra calories and get your step count up.</p>

										<br />

										<p>When you Start to workout you may find it hard, but as you progress, you will definitely find it easier, like the 1st time you walked around the block – you come home you’re tired, you wake up with sore legs the next day. However a few weeks later you can do the walk in ½ the amount of time, you’re not tired when you get home, and your legs are no longer sore. This means your body and your mind are now used to this activity if you want to continue to see results you must continue to challenge your body and mind in different movements and actions.</p>
