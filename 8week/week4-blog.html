										<p>Meal planning is the key to better eating. Deciding and planning your meals ahead of time will guarantee success with your current goal. Planning your meals ahead of time will also save you time and money. How many times a week do you supermarket shop? Or how many times a week are you hungry, but can't be bothered cooking so just grab the first thing you see? Both of these are setting you up for a fail. If you do your shop in one day with a plan and guide of what you want to eat that week, it will save you money by not getting things you don't actually need, and by planning your meals and prepping them will, in turn, stop you from grabbing the easiest not so healthy option. Below are some ideas you can incorporate in, your daily /weekly meal plans to make it a bit easier to get started: </p>

										<h5><b>Breakfast</b></h5>
			                        	
										<p>Breakfast Being the most important meal of the day, it is definitely worth getting this right. Breakfast is the first thing you put in your mouth so if you are a person who can not eat straight away when you 1st get up, that’s ok just pack your breakfast and take it with you and then when you are hungry eat it then. I hear too many stories of people who don't eat breakfast then at 10 am they are hungry so go for an early lunch at this point it's unlikely to eat healthy you are busy and just grab the closest thing, for example, stopping at the servo for a pie or raiding the staff rooms chocolate biscuit stash. Breakfast doesn't need to be the same every day either there are so many options to put on your plate at this time of the day, below are just a few examples.  </p>

										<h5><b>Lunch</b></h5>
                                        <p>Lunch is the meal we have in the middle of the day, to top us up, fuel our bodies so we can have enough energy to get through the afternoon, where we tend to be the most tired. This is a great time to eat Carbohydrates our complex ones, as we still have most of the day to burn it off. Lunch times again will be different for most, at work we often get told when we have to eat, unfortunately, this is very common and can muck up some people's days food wise. If you can talk to your boss maybe you can change your lunch break to suit or eat whilst you are working.</p>
                                        <p>Some examples for Lunchtime are Salads made with grains such as</p>

                                        </ul>

                                </div>

                                        <h5><b>Dinner</b></h5>
										<p> For most people, this is the time of day we have our main meal, where we consume the most food of the day. For me, that makes no sense as it’s the last meal so we are usually not doing much after it. I would recommend depending on what you do in the evening for this to be the smallest but the most nutritious meal.</p>
                                        <p>Including foods high in Protein Low in Carbohydrates and moderate fat intake.</p>
                                        <p>My favorite meal to have at this time is a stir-fry 2/3 meat/protein, 1/3 Carbohydrate/ vegetables (green) topped with cheese or avocado or sour cream.</p>
                                        <br />

                                        <h5><b>Snacks</b></h5>

                                        <p>Snacks are something we have in between our main meals, not as a replacement for a meal. I recommend being careful at this point as you don't want to eat too much and compromise your other meals.</p><p>Some great snack ideas are:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Protein Balls</b></li>
                                            <li><b>Smoothies Fruit</b></li>
                                            <li><b>Greek yogurt with berries</b></li>
                                            <li><b>Nuts and dried fruit</b></li>
                                        </ul>

										<br />
                                        <p>I generally plan all my snacks for the week too, so I don't reach for an easier option.</p>
                                        <p>Below is the link to a meal plan you can use to practice on for the next few days. Then on from Thursday, you can start planning the following week through the app!</p>
