		                	<p>Set a plan in place, that includes smart, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-framed goals.  Write these goals down and stick them to your mirror, say your goals out loud to yourself every morning. As motivation is the key the more realistic your weekly goal is the more achievable it becomes, motivating you to achieve it.</p>

									<a href="assets\downloads\exercise plan (1).pdf"><h3> <b> <i class="material-icons">file_download</i> </b> Activity Tracker Sheet</h3></a>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>Below is a link to an exercise plan. This tool is great to write down everything you want to achieve actively for the next week, then tick off each activity as you do it. If you can't do a session for any reason use the comment box to explain why. Then for the following week try to eliminate these obstacles for next time.</p>

							</div>
							<p>For the same reason as the exercise plan, a food plan is also super important, this tool will help you see habits first hand, some habits you may not know you do and then you can start eliminating them in your favour.</p>
							
							
							<h3><b>Hydration</b></h3> 

							<div class="container inset">

										<h3 class="card-title">Water</h3>
									</a>
									<p>Water is important and helps your body function at it’s best, it is necessary for all digestive, absorption, circulatory, and excretory functions. Water also helps maintain proper body temperature.

							</div>

							<p>Water is the most critical nutrient you can give your body. Water is needed to balance all of the bodies systems, including the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, and muscles. Mild dehydration is the main cause of daytime fatigue, by keeping up your water intake during the day, you will in turn feel better, more awake to get things done, like exercise. You will also feel less hungry. One of the main reasons we feel hungry is that we are dehydrated, so next time have a glass of water before and reap the rewards.</p>
								
							
							<h3><b>Sleep</b></h3> 

							<div class="container inset">
								<div class="card card-raised blog-card " style="background-image: url('sleep1.jpg')">

										<h3 class="card-title">Sleep</h3>
									</a>
									<p>We all know how important sleep is and how it effects our day if we don’t get enough. Not only does it play a huge role in brain function learning and retaining information sleep also is massive when we are trying to lose the extra weight, and is usually the key behind some people’s fitness journeys.

							</div>

							<p>Sleep is very important for every fitness goal and health benefits. With weight loss though it plays a crucial role especially if you are training as well. Our bodies recover the most whilst we sleep, so if you are training hard and eating well, sleep may be the factor stopping you from achieving these goals. Being tired sets your brain to make bad decisions, like skipping training and bad food choices.</p>
							<h3><b>Meditation & Yoga</b></h3> 
							<p>Meditation is a cost-free strategy, that is used to clear the mind, as you embark on your journey to a healthier you, you may find meditation a great tool to use. A lot of the time we can find ourselves eating extra when we are stressed to help calm ourselves down, however, you can eliminate this feeling be meditating for only 5 minutes a day. If you have never meditated before, I found including Yoga to my routine helped. Just by slowing down my training 2 days a week I found I was calmer and more relaxed, in turn when I transitioned to Meditating it was a lot easier to turn off and relax.</p>
