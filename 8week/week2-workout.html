	                        <p >5 Exercises and 5 minutes is the method I used when starting to implement exercise into my life. One of the many excuses I hear and use to say myself was that I'm too busy to exercise!</p>
							<p >Have you said that before?</p>
                            <p>Thatâ€™s why this workout is so great everyone has a spare 5 minutes right?</p>
                            <p>Set Your timer to 5 minutes starting with the best level to suit your fitness level.</p>
                            <p>Completing each exercise for 10 repetitions each, then moving to the next exercise with little to no rest in between. When you get to the end of the list of exercises, start from the start again trying to get through as many rounds within the 5 minutes as you can. Try to beat your score during the 5 weeks. Once you reach at least 3 rounds move to the next level.</p>
                            <p>Each week put the time up so in week 2 start with 5-minute rounds, week 3 do 10-minute rounds and week 4 15 minute rounds. </p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 1</h5> 
                                <h4><b>Incline Press Up</b></h4>      
                                <p>If you are not confident in doing press ups this is a great way to start, choose a stable surface area like a table or your kitchen bench or if you think you could go lower you could use a chair or a coffee table.
                                </p><p>Set up so your hands are shoulder-width apart and your body is at an angle, bring your chest towards the table. 
                                </p><p>Tip. Keep your core braced and exhale when you are pushing yourself away from the table
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 2</h5> 
                                <h4><b>Knee Press up</b></h4>      
                                <p>Moving away from the bench now you have the right movement, just not enough strength yet.
                                </p><p>Set up by having your hands flat on the floor shoulder-width apart and directly under your shoulders. Have your knees on the ground at a slight lean creating a lever. Bring your chest to the ground and back up. 
                                </p><p>Tip Keep your core braced and exhale when you are pushing yourself away from the ground.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 3</h5> 
                                <h4><b>Full Press ups</b></h4>      
                                <p>If you are completing the knee press up with ease Now try the full press up.
                                </p><p>Awesome for toning your arms and core, this exercise can be done anywhere, so perfect for maintaining fitness on a busy schedule.
                                </p><p>Same set up as before except this time lift your knees off the ground so you are balancing on your hands and toes, bring your chest to the ground until your arms are parallel to the floor.
                                </p><p>Tip brace your core and exhale when pushing yourself away from the floor.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 1</h5>      
                                <p>Starting with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes slightly pointed outwards. Bracing your core and keeping your chest proud, slowly stick your bum out as far as it can go then bend your knees, lowering your body. For this, you could use the side of your couch.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 2</h5>       
                                <p>Repeat above set up, you could use a coffee table.</p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 3</h5>      
                                <p>Here I've used a step, which is around 20 cm off the ground.
                                </p><p>The Idea is to use something lower every time to encourage you to have a deeper squat. I find having something behind me gives me the confidence to sit back without the fear of falling onto the ground.
                                </p><p>Tip Imagine you have concrete in your heels as you push through them to get back up, also exhale on the way up.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 1</h5>      
                                <p>Standing tall, with your core braced and chest proud, take a step backward. Sit back like you do in the squat making sure the front knee is tracking over the toes. Pulse up and down for 5 times. Push through your back heel to get back to the starting position then repeat on the other leg.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 2</h5>       
                                <p>Same set up as above however after each lunge return back to the starting position, alternately using each leg 5 x on each.</p>

                                <h5 class="handwritting">level 3</h5>      
                                <p>Same as level two however you jump between the leg change.
